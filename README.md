Feel free to allocate this time as you see fit, whether it's completing the project in one sitting or spreading it out over several days.

## Project description
This application already contains the following features, but there might be some **bugs** that need to **fixed**:

  - Allows the add ToDoLists and related items.
  - Each ToDoList must have a unique title.
  - Each item must have a unique title within the ToDoList.
  - The title of a ToDoList and items cannot exceed 200 characters.
  - The ToDoList view should be refreshed after adding a new ToDoList.
  - The items of a ToDoList can be marked as done.
  - If no ToDoList is selected, adding items should not be possible.
  - If no ToDoListItem is selected or the selected item is marked as done, the done button should be disabled.
  - The ToDoListItem view should be refreshed after adding a new ToDoListItem.

## New Features
The following features need to be implemented:
- **Weather Forecast form**:
  - Add two new entities, Country and City, with a one-to-many relationship.
  - Provide seed data for countries and cities.
  - Implement a form for Weather Forecast and add two dropdowns:
    - The first dropdown for selecting a Country.
    - The second dropdown for selecting a City, which updates based on the selected Country.
    - Selecting a City triggers a mock API call (interface definition and a fake implementation required) to fetch and display the temperature of the city and display it on the form.
  - Writing tests for this feature is a plus.

- **Simple Caching System**:
  - Develop a simple in-memory cache without using third-party caching libraries.
  - Use this cache to store and manage ToDoList data, and reset it when becomes outdated.

## Guidelines
- Make sure your GitHub repository is public so that we can review your code.
- Ensure all changes are clean and optimized.
- Refactor the codebase where necessary and commit these changes independently.
- Write clear and concise commit messages reflecting each change.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers to understand and contribute effectively to the ToDoList management system. For any questions or further clarifications, please consult the project's lead developer.

We wish you the best of luck and look forward to reviewing your submission!
